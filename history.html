  <h1>The History Of Soccer</h1>
  <p>If you search this up it will tell you but since you are here i will tell you too. They say that the records trace back 200 years ago to ancient china.
    supposibly greece,rome,and parts of central america claim to have made or create the sport.

  <p>They were coming up with a bunch of names for the sport but they couldnt find one. Until some students in the 1880s found a name for the sport. Turns out that they came up with the name association football. I think they didnt like that name very much becuase later they shortened the name and called it soccer.</p>
  <p>That is pretty much the history of soccer and how it was made. I honestly didnt know that the greece and the others thought they made the sport. So there you got that is the history of soccer.</p>
